Sample_cpp_WP8sqlite
====================
This repo is a test for using sqlite-net with c++ with an existing database. 

It is a fork of http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/wpapps/Using-Sqlite-with-WP8-52c3c671

The bulk of what is going on is happening in App.xaml.cs InitializeDatabase();

and DictionarySearchManager.cs
